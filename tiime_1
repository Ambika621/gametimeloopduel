# Time Loop Duel 3D — Starter Asset Pack (Low-Poly)

Overview
This package contains starter low-poly 3D models, shadergraph recipe, textures & material naming conventions, rigging/animation guidelines, and prefab setup instructions optimized for Unity 2022.3 LTS + URP.

Default assumptions
- Unity 2022.3 LTS (recommended)
- Render Pipeline: Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
- Shader system: Shader Graph (URP)
- Platform: PC (keyboard/mouse)
- Art style: Synthwave neon (purple, blue, pink emissive)

What’s included in this pack
- Simple export-ready OBJ meshes (player, ghost, platform, pillar, ramp)
- Shader Graph recipe for neon emissive material (URP)
- Texture map guidance and naming conventions
- Rigging & animation clip list and bone naming guidelines
- Prefab setup and Unity import instructions

Next steps (after import)
1. Install URP + Shader Graph packages via Package Manager.
2. Create URP Asset and set Graphics -> Scriptable Render Pipeline settings.
3. Create materials per Shader Graph instructions and assign emissive textures.
4. Import OBJ files to Assets/TL_Duel/Models.
5. Create prefabs: add Rigidbody, Collider, Animator, and link scripts (Ghost/Player) from your code base.
6. Test glow via Post-processing (Bloom) and Tone Mapping/Color Grading.

If you want, I can:
- Generate higher-resolution FBX with a simple skeleton and baked animation clips.
- Export PNG textures (albedo, emissive, normal) as base64 placeholders.
- Produce a Unity package (.unitypackage) you can import directly.

Tell me which of the above you want next and I’ll generate it immediately.
